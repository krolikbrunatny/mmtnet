# About

It's difficult to write about yourself and I find it especially cute when someone does it in the third person. I've opted to create this bullet list with sentences that start with “I”:

- I'm a self-taught software engineer
- I study Physics, [<s>see my reflections after finishing 1st semester</s>]()
- I'm concerned about consequences of climate change
- I don't tell people that I'm vegan
- I enjoy cooking for my friends
- Italian cuisine is my thing
- I am a first generation of Generation Z
- I struggle(d) with ADHD and I intend to write about it
- I wish you a good day
