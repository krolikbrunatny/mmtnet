description: Important letter to myself

Welcome,

At this point, I would like to congratulate myself for publishing this short letter â€“ the one that you are currently reading.

Huh?

It might sound peculiar, but it took me approximately a solid decade to pull this off. Perfectionism, procrastination, and overthinking can be terrible. Once more, hats off to me.
