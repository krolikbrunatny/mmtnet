The title isn't a clickbait. This is how I feel after a year, so take my word for it, or better yet - try it for yourself.

This advice is powerful, but I must warn you: it doesn't suit everyone. There's a chance you're doing it already or live in unfavorable circumstances and this won't work.

## True Story

We were hanging out by the river and it was getting late.

"How the heck am I getting home?" my friend wondered aloud, already checking Google Maps.

Sure, Warsaw's public transport is usually alright, but not at this hour. You can't just walk to a bus stop and hope for the best. It's even worse when you have to take the night bus. In a stroke of money-saving genius, someone decided that night buses should take ridiculously roundabout routes. Now, your journey takes twice as long. Instead of 30 minutes, you're stuck on the bus for a whole hour, and as a bonus, you have to deal with drunk people.

One could say he could take an Uber. Right! But that's not a life hack, it's a life suck. This and many similar inconveniences can be fixed another way.

Is your life hackable? Let's find out.

## Assessment

I need you to answer two simple questions.

1. Do you commute to school/uni/work regularly?
2. Is your route 12 kilometers or less?

If you answered yes to both, then **get a fucking bike**.

_**TIP:** Choose a bike you find stylish, it should be lightweight enough to carry easily on your arm, and you should look cool riding it._

## Benefits

May vary for you, but in my case:

- I teleport to places: my trip to uni takes 22 minutes by bike vs. 35-40 minutes via direct bus.
- I'm independent: I don't need to wait for a tram or miss buses.
- I have ripped abs without caring much: I bike 15-20 km every day.
- I'm happier: biking is genuinely enjoyable; it's a form of play.
- My thoughts are clearer.

## Disadvantages

No disadvantages.
