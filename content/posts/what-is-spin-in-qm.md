description: Most accurate explanation of a spin

This semester I took a QM class. One of the lecturers is semi-famous theoretical physicist (known for popularizing physics) [Andrzej Dragan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M724P4xPQf0), who didn't turn out to be a jerk like many students thought he would. These are the best lectures I've had so far as they are driven by curiosity. Finally, they don't fool students into thinking they are learning anything just by sitting there.

Anyway, my friend Jerzy, came up with this short but precise explanation of an electron spin I wanted to share. So, what is spin?

> Imagine a ball that is spinning. However, it is not a ball, and it is not spinning.
