# Fundamentals of Creative Coding

<img alt="a poster featuring a laptop and a snake" src="/assets/workshops/1.jpg" />

Hey there!

I'd like to invite you to an intensive, hands-on workshop on creative coding.

We will explore what a computer is, how programs work, and what code is all about. From there, we will discover how to draw various shapes and bring those drawings to life, creating interesting visuals. Get ready to write a lot of code!

If you've never written any code before, don't worry, we'll start from scratch.

We'll be using JavaScript and p5.js library for our coding adventures. The concepts you'll learn will be invaluable if you choose to explore other programming languages in the future.

## Course format

The course is free of charge.

The course spans 5 days, with each day consisting of 3 hours, totaling 15 hours overall.

This is on-site course, in English. It will take place in [Teatr Komuna Warszawa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/M9MYVhRjuvsoFLh86) on the street Emilii Plater 31.
