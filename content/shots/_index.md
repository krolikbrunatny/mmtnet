# Daily Shots

The title suggests I’ll upload shots daily. While that was the original idea, it’s not going to happen. I want this to be fun, not an obligation. Still, “I’m shooting for the stars,” so I kept the title.

You can think of it as a sort of Instagram profile, but better. It’s not meant for profit at the expense of users’ mental health. I’m just sharing shots. You cannot give them a like, but feel free to <a href="mailto: {{< param author.email >}}">send me an email</a>.
